//first attempt

function math.min(1, 10) {
  if (10 > 1) {
    return 10;
    else return 1;
  };
}


//didn't work, reread hints (also realized I had to remove the period)

function min (a, b) {
if (a < b) {
return a
else return b;
}

console.log(min(1, 10));
console.log(min(0, -10));

//can't figure out why this one isn't working, exactly.
